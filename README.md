# Amazon-clone

This project is a fully responsive **Amazon Clone** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It replicates the structure and design of Amazon's homepage, focusing on layout precision, responsiveness, and user-friendly interaction.

## 📌 Why This Project?

Recreating the Amazon homepage allowed me to challenge myself with a real-world UI. Amazon’s interface is a great example of structured layout, responsiveness, and intuitive user experience. By cloning it from scratch without using frameworks or libraries, I focused on strengthening my core frontend skills — from building complex layouts to handling DOM interactions with plain JavaScript.

This project also helped me better understand design consistency, performance optimization, and mobile-first development.
